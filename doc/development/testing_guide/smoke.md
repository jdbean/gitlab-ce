Smoke Tests
===

It is imperative in any testing suite that we have Smoke Tests.  In short, smoke tests will run a quick sanity check
against the specified environment to ensure that basic functionality is working.

Currently, our suite consists of this basic functionality coverage:

- User Login (Standard Auth)
- Project Creation
- Issue Creation
- Source code can be pushed to the repository
