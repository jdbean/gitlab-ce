# Smoke Tests

It is imperative in any testing suite that we have Smoke Tests.  In short, smoke tests are will run quick sanity
end-to-end functional tests from GitLab QA and are designed to run against the specified environment to ensure that 
basic functionality is working.

Currently, our suite consists of this basic functionality coverage:

- User Login (Standard Auth)
- Project Creation
- Issue Creation
- Merge Request Creation
